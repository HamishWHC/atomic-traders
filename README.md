2. NPM Install: `npm install`
3. Copy `example.env` to `.env` and replace `token-here` with your SpaceTraders token.
4. Run the server: `npm run start`

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute bug fixes or features, but I'm not looking for this to be particularly collaborative, and won't hesitate pushing my changes directly to `master` and with many unrelated changes.
